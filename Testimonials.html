                                        "I have been a therapist since the early 80’s. I was licensed as a professional counselor in the states of Ohio and Arizona, so I have been around the block a few times. During my career I specialized in trauma and became an SEP (Somatic Experiencing Practitioner) which meant I had several years of added training in that area.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        During my tenure as a therapist, I also was a client and worked on myself and my past traumas with some of the most renowned therapists in the United States. I am saying all of this to qualify my experience with Dayna Dunbar.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        What Dayna offered me was an acknowledgment of how my spiritual path connected to my mental health. In my experiences this understanding that Dayna brought to my interaction with her has been invaluable in my healing journey. She knows what most others don’t—that trying to solve problems intellectually is problematic and keeps one in their head. She encourages a person to operate from their heart and heal the wounds from that perspective. Thanks, Dayna. You have been an asset to my healing.”

The journeys, involving deep interactional processes, were amazing and completely transformational. Her all -day integration all day at Monte Coxala on the third day was in a league no other healer I have experienced could come close to.  She took notes during the journey and touched on all the issues I was dealing with, sharing insights that were breathtakingly illuminating.  She went way beyond all expectations, she even recorded a beautiful healing meditation dealing with these core issues I was facing for me to practice with.  As a result of her high level of competence and wisdom, I experienced a powerful healing of my relationships with my ex and with my father. ​Dayna's spiritual wisdom, experience, knowledge, competence and professionalism are unmatched, and I was transformed in her presence.  I give her my highest recommendation.  She is absolutely world class.”

                                        “Working with Dayna has been a truly transformative experience. It’s hard to sum it up into words. I have always described it as therapy on steroids, even prior to having an in-person journey with her. Every virtual session we had, it felt like so much progress was made. Prior to this, I have never felt the true power of counseling because of how slow progress is made. Even in virtual sessions, there is somatic work and really clearing of issues from the body. Developing a strong relationship with her prior to the journey was extremely beneficial. It already felt like I was benefiting in many aspects of my life. The in-person journey transcended every expectation. I came in it with a very open mind and a lot of trust for Dayna. She guided me and provided me with exactly what I needed before, during and after. There was so much going on in my head, but she helped me recognize my thoughts and have clear intentions prior to the journey, which really helped address all the things I needed to in my life. The journey itself is hard to describe, but I can see how much I needed it. It would have taken years and years of talk therapy to get through that if I ever even did. I also realize how much it was necessary to have Dayna there to guide me through the process. She made sure that my intentions were addressed, and the clarity I needed was achieved. It truly feels like I have a new perspective. I have never seen things clearer. The integration after the journey with Dayna was also very important. She helped extract everything from the journey, and the way she organized all my thoughts and answers to the intentions I had was absolutely necessary to complete this journey. This is one thing I would recommend to everyone with a guarantee that it will help transform their lives for the better.”
